	abstract = {The document reviews the measurement types and processing of the size data submitted to the Secretariat and provides compelling examples of the major issues encountered in some size frequency data sets available in the IOTC database. In particular, it illustrates four cases: data inconsistencies, truncation of size distributions, duplication of size data, and discrepancies in size data between sources. Through these examples, the paper aims to recall the need for each CPC to (i) provide a thorough and up-to-date description of the data collection and curation systems in place and (ii) scrupulously follow IOTC reporting guidelines so as to reduce as much as possible the exclusion of data not compliant with IOTC standards.},

	abstract = {Growth is a crucial biological feature and a key component in quantitative fish population stock assessments. Regional tuna fisheries management organizations have conducted extensive sampling programs to measure the growth of tuna species more accurately over the last decades. Although research improved growth estimates in most cases, competing or conflicting estimates of growth characteristics due to differences in sampling coverage, aging techniques, and modeling methodologies can introduce significant bias and uncertainty in the stock assessment. In the Indian Ocean, the recently determined growth curve for the bigeye tuna stock differs significantly from the length-at-age relationship now used in stock assessment. This study looked at how new growth affected estimation of fishing mortality for bigeye tuna caught with longline. Under steady-state assumption, the analytical method derives the fishing mortality and selectivity parameters from the longline length frequency dataset, conditioned on the growth and natural mortality factors. Simple simulations were used to validate the estimator’s performance. According to the estimates, the annual fishing mortality rates under the new growth curve will be 100\%–200\% higher than those under the current growth curve. The findings were also supported by an integrated Stock Synthesis model that was derived and simplified from the current bigeye tuna assessment model, as well as the length-based spawning potential ratio method, which used the same length frequency dataset as input. We emphasize that using a basic model to analyze the impact of alternative or competing growth scenarios on key management quantities can help decision makers easily understand the outcomes of more complex models, increasing the transparency of the stock assessment process.},
